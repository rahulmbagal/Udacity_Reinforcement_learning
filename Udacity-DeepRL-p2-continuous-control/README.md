For this project, you will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.


# Below are the details of the Enviroment as per the official website mentioned:

Set-up: Double-jointed arm which can move to target locations.
Goal: The agents must move its hand to the goal location, and keep it there.
Agents: The environment contains 10 agent with same Behavior Parameters.
Agent Reward Function (independent):
+0.1 Each step agent's hand is in goal location.
Behavior Parameters:
Vector Observation space: 26 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the two arm rigid bodies.
Vector Action space: (Continuous) Size of 4, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints.
Visual Observations: None.
