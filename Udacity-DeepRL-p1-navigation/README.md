## Project Details


We will train an agent that navigate and collect babanas in the enviroment.

# Reward:
+1 reward = if agent collect a yellow Banana 
-1 reward = if agent collect blue Banana


# State Space:
There are 37 dimensions in which agent can move with velocity along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.

# Actions:
Four discrete actions are available,

0 - move forward.
1 - move backward.
2 - turn left.
3 - turn right.

Python notebook:

The code is written in python in the Navigation.ipynb notebook.

Two Techniques implemented:

with Double DQN
and with Dueling Double DQN
